# Career-Track-Enrolment
One of the functionalities the 365 company introduced in a 2021 platform release included the option for student enrollment in a career track. The tracks represent an ordinal sequence of courses that eventually lead to obtaining the skills for one of three job titles: data scientist, data analyst, or business analyst

## Objective
Completing a career track on the platform is a challenging task. To acquire a corresponding career certificate, a student must pass nine course exams (seven compulsory and two elective courses) and sit for a career track exam encompassing topics from all seven required courses.

In this Career Track Analysis with SQL and Tableau project, weâ€™re tasked with analyzing the career track enrollments and achievements of 365â€™s students. Weâ€™ll first need to retrieve the necessary information from an SQL database. Afterward, weâ€™ll feed this information to Tableau, visualize the results, and finally interpret them.


## Questions 
At the end of the visualization analysis using Tableau, we want to answer the following questions:

1. What is the number of enrolled students monthly? Which is the month with the most enrollments? Speculate about the reason for the increased numbers.
2. Which career track do students enroll most in?
3. What is the career track completion rate? Can you say if itâ€™s increasing, decreasing, or staying constant with time?
4. How long does it typically take students to complete a career track? What type of subscription is most suitable for students who aim to complete a career track: monthly, quarterly, or annual?
5. What advice and suggestions for improvement would you give the 365 team to boost engagement, increase the track completion rate, and motivate students to learn more consistently?
